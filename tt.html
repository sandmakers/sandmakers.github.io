Sand Making Machine Introduction

Sand making machine is suitable in crushing applications for soft, medium hard and extremely hard material, such as various ores, cement, refractories, aluminum where the soil clinker, carborundum, glass raw materials, mechanisms built of stone with gold slag, especially for silicon carbide, carborundum, sintered bauxite, Misa high-hard, extra hard and abrasion resistance of materials. It is especially good choice for construction sand, sand and gravel for roads.

In the engineering field, the sand making machine is ideal equipment for sand, cushion material, asphalt concrete and cement concrete aggregate. In the mining sector, sand making machine is widely used in the preceding grinding process, it can produce large amounts of iron ore fines, reducing the high cost of grinding load.

Because of its excellent low wear characteristics, sand making machine also for applied in high abrasion and secondary crushing disintegration production. In addition, because of the it's zero pollution, sand making machine can be well adapted to the production of glass quartz sand and other high purity materials in, with capacity of 10-500tph, sand making machine fits almost any production requirements.

Sand Making Machine Applcations

1 river pebbles, rocks (limestone, granite, basalt, diabase, andesite, etc.), ore tailings, the artificial sand stone chips.
2 construction aggregates, highway road fabric, cushion material, asphalt concrete and cement concrete aggregate production.
3 projects in the field of water conservancy and hydropower, highway, highway, railway, passenger line, bridges, airport runways, municipal engineering, high-rise building sand production and stone shaping.
4 front finely grinding technology in mining industry, material crushing for building materials, metallurgy, chemical, mining, refractories, cement, abrasive and other industries.
5 high abrasion and secondary crushing disintegration, thermal power, in addition to sulfur metallurgical industry, steel slag, construction waste crushing and other environmental projects.
6 glass, quartz sand and other high purity materials.

Sand Making Machine Features

1. large processing capacity, high yield 50-500tph, compared with conventional devices under the same power, production increased by 30% and stable.
2. low consumption of wearing parts: the best material impact angle crushing chamber design, less friction and wear parts, operating costs is lowered 30% than traditional equipment, directly reduces the cost of the device.
3. excellent product shape:a cube products, grain shape is good, fineness modulus is adjustable; particularly suitable for artificial sand and stone shaping, the performance has been increased 30% compared with other conventional devices, .
4.hydraulic device, easy to maintain:Hydraulic lid device, so that the crushing cavity convenient removable component overhaul, downtime, saving time and effort.
5.automatic detection, secure and reliable: with vibrating display and alarm device, if the device adverse operation, may issue a warning, so that the device stops working, to protect the machine's purpose.
6. oil lubrication, auto maintenance: German original oil lubrication station, two complementary ensure oil pump, oil flow, automatic shutdown when there is no oil; oil cooling and heating devices ensure that the bearing lubrication is always at its best. Thus completely solve the heat problem bearings, spindle bearings to maintain constant temperature, extended maintenance intervals and service life.
7. easy to install, easy to operate: light weight of the equipment, diverse and mobile installation; repair and maintenance is simple and easy to operate; VSI sand making machine can play its superior performance once purpose is clear and specific.
8. a multi-use, flexible application: a unique feeding crushing structure, with a variety of crushing cavity can easily achieve "rock on rock" and "stone blacksmith" conversion, so as to solve the problem of the machine. If you want to change the application VSI crusher, no big adjustment can adapt to the different applications: artificial sand, gravel, plastic, abrasive materials.

Artificial sand

Artificial sand by definition is the use of mechanical equipment of artificial sand, through the stone inside the stone. Stone iron is a process to transform stones into sand. Surface roughness of artificial sand granules, angular, union between aggregate and cement, aggregate, and high mechanical forces, than of concrete using artificial sand with high natural sand in concrete strength. But in the process of stone processing, due to the fierce collision, and the stone itself is under a certain amount of soil, which contains a certain amount of powder with artificial sand and peat powder. Presence of shaly sand gradation will be severely affected. While stone exists can bridge the gap resulted in concrete with artificial sand, water requirements, liquidity disadvantages. In order to solve the problem of artificial sand powder content, learn principles of river sand, built sand washing machine, by sand washing machine washing away sand the inside of the clay powder, so that the standards achieved with artificial sand building sand, this method is called wet line.

VSI sand making machine

VSI sand maker series is to introduce Germany advanced technology development and production, with international advanced level of high-performance sand equipment system, its performance in a fine break of various ores equipment plays an irreplaceable role. Vertical shaft impact crusher (sand making machine), "stone to stone" and "stone to iron" are two type, "stone to stone" is used for high abrasion material processing "stone blacksmith" is used for abrasive material processing are not good, "stone-bashing" than "Shi shi"-sand ratio reflected higher.

1. Simple and rational structure, low operation cost. 
2. High breaking rate and energy saving. 
3. Little affected by moisture content, moisture content of up to 8% per cent. 
4. is more suitable for crushing of hard, hard materials. 
5. Excellent grain shape, a cube, needle and plate were very low.

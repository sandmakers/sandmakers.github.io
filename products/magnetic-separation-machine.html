Under the action of the magnetic field, the magnetic mineral grains get together and &quot;magnetic magnetic group&quot; or &quot;magnetic chain&quot; come into being . &quot;magnetic group&quot; or &quot;magnetic chain&quot; move to magnetic poles and be adsorbed in the cylinder under the influence of magnetic in the pulp. The polarity of the cylinder poles arranges alternately along the direction of rotation and it is changeless when working. When &quot;magnetic group&quot; or &quot;magnetic chain&quot; rotate with the cylinder, matrix and other Non-magnetic minerals which were mingled in the &quot;magnetic group&quot; or &quot;magnetic chain&quot; fall out in the flipping because of magnetic phenomenon, was eventually suck in cylinder surface &quot;magnetic group&quot; or &quot;magnetic Ephraim&quot; is concentrate. Concentrate with cylinder turned to the edge of the weak magnetic force in the ore discharge, washing water hoses under the action of unloading was to concentrate slot, if is the magnetic magnetic roller, unloaded ore is to use brush roller.
